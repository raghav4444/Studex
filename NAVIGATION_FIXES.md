# Navigation and Profile Fixes

## ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Profile Page Missing from Navigation**
**Problem:** The profile page was not accessible in the desktop navigation because it was outside the visible tabs (only first 7 were shown, profile was at index 7).

**Solution:**
- Reorganized the tabs array to include Profile in the top 6 most important tabs
- New order: Home, Notes, Events, Groups, Chat, Profile, Mentorship, Jobs, Notifications, Skills
- Profile is now at index 5, making it visible in desktop navigation

### 2. **Responsive Navigation**
**Problem:** Navigation wasn't properly responsive across different screen sizes.

**Solution:**
- **Large screens (lg+):** Shows 8 tabs (Home through Jobs)
- **Medium screens (md to lg):** Shows 6 tabs + "More" dropdown for additional tabs
- **Mobile screens (< md):** Hamburger menu with full navigation sidebar
- All screen sizes now have access to all features including Profile and Chat

### 3. **Username Display and Update**
**Problem:** Username functionality was not fully integrated into the profile page.

**Solution:**
- Updated ProfilePage to use actual user data from AuthProvider
- Added edit button next to username display
- Integrated UsernameUpdate component with modal overlay
- Users can now click the edit icon to update their username
