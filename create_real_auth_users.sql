-- Alternative: Create real auth users (more complex but proper)
-- This requires admin privileges and is more involved

-- First, let's check what auth tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'auth' 
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check the current FK constraint
SELECT 
  tc.constraint_name, 
  tc.table_name, 
  kcu.column_name, 
  ccu.table_schema AS foreign_table_schema, 
  ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name, 
  ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu 
  ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name 
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu 
  ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name 
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
  AND tc.table_name = 'profiles';

-- If you want to create real auth users, you'd need to:
-- 1. Use Supabase Auth API from your application
-- 2. Or use admin functions (requires special permissions)

-- For now, let's just verify the constraint points to auth.users
SELECT 'Check the results above to see which table the FK references' as instruction;
