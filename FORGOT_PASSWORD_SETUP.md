# Forgot Password Feature Setup

## Overview
The forgot password functionality has been successfully implemented using Supabase Auth. Users can now reset their passwords through a secure email-based process.

## Features Added

### 1. **Forgot Password Link**
- Added "Forgot your password?" link below the password field in the login form
- Opens a modal dialog for password reset

### 2. **Password Reset Modal**
- Clean, modern UI matching the app's design
- Email input validation
- Success/error states with proper feedback
- Loading states during the reset process

### 3. **Email Integration**
- Uses Supabase's built-in `resetPasswordForEmail` function
- Sends secure password reset links to user's email
- Redirects to the app's reset password page

### 4. **Reset Password Page**
- Dedicated page for users who click the reset link in their email
- Password confirmation validation
- Success confirmation after password update
- Automatic redirect back to sign-in

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **User clicks "Forgot your password?"** on the login form
2. **Modal opens** asking for their email address
3. **User enters email** and clicks "Send Reset Link"
4. **Email sent** to their inbox with a secure reset link
5. **User clicks link** in email (redirects to reset password page)
6. **User enters new password** and confirms it
7. **Password updated** successfully
8. **Redirected back** to sign-in page

### Technical Implementation:
- `resetPassword()` function in `useSupabaseAuth.ts`
- Modal component in `LoginForm.tsx`
- `ResetPasswordForm.tsx` for the reset page
- URL parameter detection in `App.tsx` for reset links
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Files Modified/Created

## Supabase Configuration

The feature works with Supabase's default email templates. For production, you may want to:

1. **Customize Email Templates** in Supabase Dashboard:
   - Go to Authentication > Email Templates
   - Customize the "Reset Password" template
   - Update the redirect URL to match your domain

2. **Configure SMTP** (optional):
   - Use your own email service for better deliverability
   - Configure in Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > SMTP Settings

## Testing

To test the forgot password feature:

1. **Start the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Go to login page** and click "Forgot your password?"
3. **Enter a valid email** that exists in your database
4. **Check your email** for the reset link
5. **Click the link** to test the reset password page
6. **Enter new password** and confirm it works

## Security Notes

- âœ… Uses Supabase's secure password reset flow
- âœ… Reset links expire automatically (default: 1 hour)
- âœ… Password validation (minimum 6 characters)
- âœ… Confirmation password matching
- âœ… Proper error handling and user feedback
- âœ… No sensitive data exposed in URLs (uses tokens)

## Production Considerations

1. **Update redirect URL** in `useSupabaseAuth.ts` line 342:
   ```typescript
   redirectTo: `${window.location.origin}/reset-password`
   ```
   Change to your production domain.

2. **Customize email templates** in Supabase Dashboard for branding

3. **Test email delivery** to ensure reset emails reach users

4. **Monitor error rates** and user feedback for improvements

The forgot password feature is now fully functional and ready for use! ðŸŽ‰
