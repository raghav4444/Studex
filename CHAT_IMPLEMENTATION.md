- Added proper indexes and RLS policies

### ✅ Components Created

- `ChatPage` - Main chat page combining list and window
- `UsernameUpdate` - Username update component for profile

### ✅ Hooks Created

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
Run the SQL migration file to set up the chat tables:

```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: supabase/migrations/20250101000000_add_chat_and_username.sql
```

### 2. Update Your Profile Page
To add username update functionality to your profile page, import and use the `UsernameUpdate` component:

```tsx
import UsernameUpdate from './UsernameUpdate';

// In your ProfilePage component, add:
const [showUsernameUpdate, setShowUsernameUpdate] = useState(false);

// Add a button to trigger username update:
<button onClick={() => setShowUsernameUpdate(true)}>
  Edit Username
</button>

// Add the component:
{showUsernameUpdate && (
  <UsernameUpdate
    currentUsername={user.username}
    onUpdate={(newUsername) => {
      // Update local user state
      setUser({ ...user, username: newUsername });
      setShowUsernameUpdate(false);
    }}
    onCancel={() => setShowUsernameUpdate(false)}
  />
)}
```

### 3. Navigation
The chat functionality is already integrated into your app navigation. Users can access it via the "Chat" tab in the header.

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Search
1. Click the "+" button in the chat list
2. Search for users by username, name, or email
3. Click on a user to start a conversation
4. If no conversation exists, one is automatically created

### Real-time Messaging
1. Messages are sent instantly using Supabase real-time subscriptions
2. Users see messages as they're sent
3. Messages are marked as read automatically when viewing a conversation
4. Online status is tracked and displayed

### Username System
1. Each user gets a unique username generated from their email/name
2. Usernames can be updated in the profile page
3. Username validation ensures uniqueness and proper format
4. Users can be searched by username

## 🔧 Customization

### Styling
All components use Tailwind CSS classes that match your existing dark theme. You can easily customize colors by modifying the CSS classes.

### Message Types
The system supports text, image, and file messages. To add more types, update the `messageType` enum in the types file and add corresponding UI in the `ChatWindow` component.

### Real-time Features
The chat uses Supabase's real-time subscriptions. You can extend this to include:
- Typing indicators
- Message reactions
- Message editing/deletion
- Voice messages

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Username conflicts**: The system automatically handles username conflicts by checking availability before updates.

2. **Real-time not working**: Ensure your Supabase project has real-time enabled and RLS policies are correctly set.

3. **Messages not loading**: Check that the user has proper permissions to read messages in their conversations.

### Database Permissions
Make sure your RLS policies allow:
- Users to read/write their own conversations
- Users to read/write messages in conversations they participate in
- Users to search other users' profiles

## 🚀 Next Steps

Consider adding these features:
- **Group chats** with multiple participants
- **Message reactions** and replies
- **File sharing** with preview
- **Voice messages**
- **Chat notifications** with push notifications
- **Message search** within conversations
- **Chat backup** and export functionality

## 📱 Mobile Support

The chat interface is fully responsive and works great on mobile devices. The layout automatically adjusts between desktop (side-by-side) and mobile (stacked) views.
